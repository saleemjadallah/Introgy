    script: `Find a comfortable seated position where your spine can be relatively straight. [pause]

Take a few moments to settle in, noticing the weight of your body being supported. [pause]

Choose a single point of focus—this could be your breath at the nostrils, a simple object in front of you, or a point on the wall. [pause]

Bring your full attention to this chosen point. [pause]

When you notice your mind wandering—which is natural and will happen often—gently return your attention to your chosen focus point. [pause]

Each time you notice your attention has wandered and you bring it back, you're strengthening your concentration—just as you build muscle by lifting and lowering a weight. [pause]

If you find yourself becoming frustrated with mind-wandering, remember this is not about perfection but about the practice of returning, again and again. [pause]

Now, see if you can slightly extend the duration of your focused attention before it wanders. [pause]

Notice the quality of your attention—is it tight and strained, or relaxed and clear? Aim for the latter. [pause]

As introverts, we often have a natural capacity for deep focus—this practice helps us refine this ability. [pause]

For the final minute, maintain your focus with renewed intention. [pause]

As we close, recognize that this simple practice, done regularly, can significantly enhance your ability to concentrate in all areas of life. [pause]

Slowly expand your awareness back to the room around you.`,

    script: `Begin by settling into a comfortable position where you feel both relaxed and alert. [pause]

Take several deep breaths, feeling your body becoming more present with each exhale. [pause]

Bring to mind a task or project that requires your deep focus and engagement. [pause]

Now, imagine clearing a space—both physically and mentally—for this single activity. [pause]

Set a clear intention for what you will focus on, making it specific enough to engage with immediately. [pause]

Take a moment to connect with your motivation for this task—not just external requirements, but what meaningful aspect of it calls to you. [pause]

Now, visualize yourself engaged in this activity with full absorption—time falling away, self-consciousness diminishing, and your attention merging with the activity itself. [pause]

Recognize potential distractions that might arise, and mentally rehearse gently redirecting your attention back to your focus. [pause]

Take a few moments to notice any resistance or hesitation about fully engaging with this task, acknowledging these feelings without judgment. [pause]

As you prepare to begin your focused work, set an intention to trust your natural rhythm—allowing yourself to settle into the work gradually, knowing that flow often emerges after the initial resistance. [pause]

Remember that as an introvert, your capacity for deep, sustained focus is a natural strength—one that becomes more accessible with practice. [pause]

Take one final deep breath, and as you exhale, imagine yourself crossing a threshold into your focused state. [pause]

When you're ready, gently open your eyes and begin your work with this quality of presence.`,

    script: `Find a comfortable position and allow your body to settle. [pause]

Take three deep breaths, making each exhale slightly longer than the inhale. [pause]

Bring awareness to your current mental state—noticing if there's clarity or cloudiness, spaciousness or crowding, calm or agitation. [pause]

Without trying to change anything yet, simply observe the quality of your thoughts. [pause]

Now, imagine your mind as a clear blue sky, and your thoughts as clouds passing through it. [pause]

Notice that regardless of how many clouds are present, the sky itself—your awareness—remains spacious and unchanged. [pause]

For the next few moments, practice being the observer of your thoughts rather than being caught in them. When you notice yourself getting pulled into a thought stream, gently return to the perspective of the sky. [pause]

Now, with each breath, imagine creating just a bit more space between your thoughts. [pause]

If your mind is particularly busy, you might silently note "thinking, thinking" when you notice thought activity, then return to the sensation of your breath. [pause]

Remember that mental clarity isn't about having no thoughts—it's about having a spacious relationship with the thoughts that arise. [pause]

As we close, notice the quality of your attention now compared to when we began. [pause]

Carry this sense of mental spaciousness with you as you gently return your awareness to your surroundings.`,
