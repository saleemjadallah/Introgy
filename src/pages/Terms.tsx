If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the said section, and the other sections of the Terms will remain in full force and effect. If any provision of these Terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed. The remainder of the Terms will remain in full force and effect. The severed provision will be replaced by an enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision.
